==== CSS Stylesheets ====

Most of DokuWiki's presentation can be controlled through CSS stylesheets. DokuWiki defines some very minimal styles itself. The rest of the CSS definitions come from the [[doku>template]] and [[doku>plugins]] used.

All CSS files are fetched through a single dispatcher in [[xref>lib/exe/css.php]] which also handles caching, pattern replacement, [[doku>devel:less|LESS]] preprocessing and optimizing. The loading of the stylesheets amongst other things is done via the ''tpl_metaheaders()'' function, so don't forget to have it within your template.

=== Stylesheet Modes ===

There are five types of stylesheet modes:

  * **screen**: This is used when displaying pages in the web browser
  * **print**: Definitions here will be used for printing pages
  * **all**: Applied in all display modes
  * **feed**: Applied when displaying the [[doku>:syndication|feed]]
